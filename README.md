A React Native playground

## How to get started

Step 1: 

You'll need Node.js version 10 LTS or later installed. If not then download it from this site https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
The first thing you'll need to do to make a quick start with React Native is to install the Expo CLI. 
Do this with the following command in you terminal:

"npm install -g expo-cli"

Step 2: PLEASE NOTE: Skip this step if you only want to view an existing app.

When installation is finished start a new project where you'll be able to choose a template for your app with command:

"expo init NameYourApp"

Step 3: 

To get you app running:
"cd NameOfApp"
"npm start" or "expo start"

This will open Expo DevTool in your web browser where you can choose if you would like to preview you app in your browser or another device. If you would like to preview in a mobile device go ahead and download "Expo" from App Store or Android Market on your device. 
You don't need to sign up on Expo.
Start the Expo app and scan the QR-code generated in your terminal or in your browser on Android device. On IOS simply open up your camera app an scan the QR-code from there.  

Step 4: 

Now you should be able to edit your App.js in your project and get it live updated on your device or browser. 

Tips: To get all the functions working I recommend to preview on a mobile device and not only your browser.
